<h1>The Best Movies According to Logan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Flushed Away</h3>
<p>You say nostalgia, but I say it is the script, and of course Hugh Jackman.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Am I a victim of a mind heist? I guess we will never know. Hans Zimmer is the GOAT.</p>

<h3>Better Call Saul</h3>
<p>Now this is not a movie, but every episode should be considered one.</p>
